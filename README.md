# Employee Leave Management System

A full-stack web application for managing employee leave requests, approvals, and tracking built with FastAPI backend and React Vite frontend.

## üìã Overview

This system automates the process of managing employee leave requests, approvals, and tracking, improving transparency and reducing manual overhead in organizations. It provides a centralized platform for employees to manage their leave applications and for administrators to track leave balances.

## üöÄ Features

### Core Functionality
- **User Authentication** - JWT-based secure login system
- **Leave Management** - Apply, track, and manage leave requests
- **Leave Type Categorization** - Casual, sick, emergency leaves
- **Real-time Dashboard** - View leave summaries and balances
- **Pagination** - Efficient data handling for large datasets
- **Search & Filter** - Find employees by ID, name, month, and year

### User Features
- Employee profile management
- Leave application submission
- Leave history tracking
- Real-time leave balance updates
- Monthly leave summaries

## üõ† Technology Stack

### Backend
- **FastAPI** - High-performance Python web framework
- **PostgreSQL** - Robust relational database
- **SQLAlchemy** - Python ORM for database interactions
- **Pydantic** - Data validation and settings management
- **JWT** - JSON Web Tokens for authentication
- **Python 3.8+** - Programming language

### Frontend
- **React** - JavaScript library for UI
- **Vite** - Fast build tool and development server
- **Material UI (MUI)** - React component library
- **Axios** - HTTP client for API calls
- **React Router** - Navigation and routing

### Development Tools
- **Postman** - API testing
- **Navicat** - Database management

## üìÅ System Architecture
Client (React Vite) ‚Üî REST API (FastAPI) ‚Üî Database (PostgreSQL)

### Data Flow
1. User interacts with React frontend
2. Frontend makes API calls to FastAPI backend using Axios
3. Backend processes requests with JWT authentication
4. SQLAlchemy ORM interacts with PostgreSQL database
5. Response sent back to frontend for UI updates

## üóÉ Database Schema

The system uses PostgreSQL with the following main tables:

### Core Tables
- **users** - Employee information (name, email, designation, role, manager)
- **leave_applications** - Leave requests with status, duration, and reasons
- **leave_types** - Categories of leaves (casual, sick, emergency)
- **leave_details** - Employee entitlements per leave type
- **remaining_leaves** - Total and remaining leaves per employee per year
- **profiles** - Extended employee profile information
